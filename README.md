# mollia_bullet

**mollia_bullet** is a Python library exposing the [bullet3](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) C++ API for rigid body simulation with additional features promoting deterministic outcome after loading or saving the world state. Extra features include aggregate control of multiple motors using numpy arrays and a debug color mesh generated for any world state for a simplified renderer.
